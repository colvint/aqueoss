# Streams

A "stream" is a Node JS app which consumes from a single topic T1 and produces to single topic T2. Streams are distinguished from [Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) which are created within the Kafka API itself. Streams are used when the data processing use case involves data from an external data source or service.
